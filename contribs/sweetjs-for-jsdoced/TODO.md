#possible improvements

* do the jsdoc parsing at compilation stage
    - as it is at compilation stage
    - maybe i could parse the jsdoc comment now
    - instead of doing it dynamically
* possible to do all at compile time
    - jsdoced + betterjs type checking
    - as it is inlined, it is likely much faster to run
